* Turn lights on when somebody enters a room and off a while after the room is empty
* Text me and/or my wife when the washer or dryer in our basement completes a cycle, but only texts us if we're home. If we're not home it waits until one of us arrives home and then texts whoever is home.
* Texts me if a person is spotted on our front door or driveway webcam (using integration with SecuritySpy, whose motion detection of people vs. other motion is quite good), based on a schedule of my choosing. I can also enable/disable it remotely from my iPhone.
* Automatically goes into a "vacation mode" if both my wife & I are away from the house for more than 12 hours, at which point lights throughout the house are turned off/on to simulate how we use them when we're actually home.
* Texts me if a smoke detector goes off, and if one goes off at night it turns all the house lights on as well.
* Turns off our water main if water is detected in the basement, and also texts me if that happens.
* During the spring/summer/fall I have it water some of my wifes outdoor plants from rain barrels where we collect rainwater, but only if it's not raining.
